## My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repo!

This is a refactor of [my old portfolio](https://github.com/alliecaton/alliecaton-portfolio). Looks pretty much the same, but I made my original portfolio when I first learned to code, and it was a terrible developer experience to add to it. I rewrote it using React Hooks instead of React Comonents, and styled with Tailwind.

The design of my portfolio is heavily inspired by my favorite text editor theme, [FairyFloss](https://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/) by [Sailorhg](https://sailorhg.com/). Take a peek around the repo!
